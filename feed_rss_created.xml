During the last 12 months we ran millions of workflows for our customers and now ready to share some insightsinto price performance of them for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key difference with Cirrus Runners is how they are getting billed for. Customers purchase Cirrus Runners via monthly subscriptionthat costs $150 per each Cirrus Runner. Each runner can be used 24 hours a day 7 days a week to run GitHub Actions workflowsfor an organization. If there are more outstanding jobs than available runners then they are queued and executed as soon asthere is a free runner. This is different from how GitHub-managed GitHub Actions are billed for — you pay for each minute of execution time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of a fixed price is that you can run as many jobs as you want without worrying about the cost. The downside is thatyou need to make sure that you are using your runners efficiently. This is where the new dashboard comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://tart.run/blog/2023/11/03/new-dashboard-with-insights-into-performance-of-cirrus-runners/</link> <pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://tart.run/feed_rss_created.xml">Tart</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://tart.run/blog/2023/11/03/new-dashboard-with-insights-into-performance-of-cirrus-runners/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Tart is now available on AWS Marketplace</title> <author>fkorotkov</author> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Tart is now available on AWS Marketplace&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-qczco34wlkdws&#34;&gt;official AMIs for EC2 Mac Instances&lt;/a&gt;with preconfigured Tart installation that is optimized to work within AWS infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EC2 Mac Instances is a gem of engineering powered by AWS Nitro devices.

And how do we establish an SSH connection with a VM running on a remote worker through all these hoops?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://tart.run/blog/2023/04/28/ssh-over-grpc-or-how-orchard-simplifies-accessing-vms-in-private-networks/</link> <pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://tart.run/feed_rss_created.xml">Tart</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://tart.run/blog/2023/04/28/ssh-over-grpc-or-how-orchard-simplifies-accessing-vms-in-private-networks/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Announcing Orchard orchestration for managing macOS virtual machines at scale</title> <author>fkorotkov</author> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Announcing Orchard orchestration for managing macOS virtual machines at scale&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we are happy to announce general availability of Orchard – our new orchestrator to manage Tart virtual machines at scale.In this post we’ll cover the motivation behind creating yet another orchestrator and why we didn’t go with Kubernetes or Nomad integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What problem are we trying to solve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After releasing Tart we pretty quickly started getting requests about managing macOS virtual machines on a cluster ofApple Silicon machines rather than just a single host which only allows a maximum of two virtual machines at a time.By the end of 2022 the requests reached a tipping point, and we started planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://tart.run/blog/2023/04/25/announcing-orchard-orchestration-for-managing-macos-virtual-machines-at-scale/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://tart.run/feed_rss_created.xml">Tart</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://tart.run/blog/2023/04/25/announcing-orchard-orchestration-for-managing-macos-virtual-machines-at-scale/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Changing Tart License</title> <author>fkorotkov</author> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Changing Tart License&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; We are transitioning Tart&#39;s licensing from AGPL-3.0 to &lt;a href=&#34;https://fair.io/&#34;&gt;Fair Source 100&lt;/a&gt;. This change willpermit unlimited installations on personal computers, but organizations that exceed a certain number of serverinstallations utilizing 100 CPU cores will be required to obtain a paid license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly a year ago on February 11th 2022 we started working on Tart – a tiny CLI to run macOS virtual machines on Apple Silicon.Three months later we successfully started using Tart in our own production system and decided to share Tart with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/raw/main/Resources/TartSocial.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to establish a community of users and contributors to transform Tart from a small CLI to a robust toolfor various scenarios. &lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, we were not successful in attracting a significant number of contributors.&lt;/strong&gt;It&#39;s important to note that we did have seven individuals who contributed to the development of Tart to the best oftheir abilities. However, one of the challenges of contributing to Tart is that the skill set required for a contributionis vastly different from the skill set typically possessed by regular Tart users in their daily work. Specifically,a contributor needs to have knowledge of the Swift programming language, as well as a background in operating systemsand network stack. This is the reason why &lt;strong&gt;98.8% of the code and all the major features were contributed by Cirrus Labs engineers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://tart.run/blog/2023/02/11/changing-tart-license/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://tart.run/feed_rss_created.xml">Tart</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://tart.run/blog/2023/02/11/changing-tart-license/</guid> </item> </channel></rss>
